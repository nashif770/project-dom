          Step into a galaxy teeming with civilizations, intrigue, and endless
          possibilities. In this game, youâ€™ll manage planets, trade resources,
          build fleets, and participate in galaxy-wide conflicts to shape the
          future of your empire. The journey begins with managing a single
          planet but could end with you ruling entire sectors of space.
