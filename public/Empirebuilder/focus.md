Focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)—a basic version of the game that works.

    One empire.
    Simple planetary management system.
    Basic resource trading.
    Limited shipbuilding mechanics.

Once that’s working, you can expand with more systems and depth.
4. Document Everything

Create a Game Design Document (GDD) to organize your ideas.

    Core Gameplay Mechanics: Define each gameplay system clearly.
    Routes and Progression: List how each route works and connects to the empire.
    Player Interactions: Detail how players interact with each other and the empire.
    Feature Wishlists: Keep extra ideas in a “future features” section so you don’t forget them but don’t get distracted.

5. Use Visual Aids

Create flowcharts or diagrams to visualize systems like:

    Player Progression: How players grow and unlock new abilities.
    Game Economy: How resources flow between players, planets, and the empire.
    PVP and PVE Dynamics: How players compete and collaborate.

6. Build in Phases

Plan development in chunks:

    Phase 1: Basic planetary management and trading system.
    Phase 2: Add shipbuilding and exploration.
    Phase 3: Introduce advanced routes and PVP mechanics.
    Phase 4: Expand with diplomacy, alliances, and megaprojects.
